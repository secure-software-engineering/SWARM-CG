questions_based_1 = """## Task Description

**Objective**: Examine and identify the function calls in the given {language} code and answer the questions.

**Instructions**:
1. For each question below, provide a concise answer indicating the function calls.
2. List every function call as a comma separated list.
3. Do not include additional explanations or commentary in your answers.
4. Include both explicit and implicit function calls in your answers. An implicit function call is a function that is called as a result of another operation, such as the __init__ method being called when an object is created.
5. If a function is called through an alias or a reference, identify and list the actual function that is called after resolving the alias.
6. Example of {language} code, questions, and answers are given below. This example should be used as training data.

**Format for Answers**:
- Provide your answer next to each question number, using only one word.
- Example:
    1. simple.func
    2. simple.examplefunc
    3. func

**Example Python Code**: 
```python
def return_func():
    func()

def func():
    a = return_func
    return a

a = func
a()()
```

**Example Questions**:
1. What are the module level function calls in the file "main.py"?
2. What are the function calls inside the "main.return_func" function in the file "main.py"?
3. What are the function calls inside the "main.func" function in the file "main.py"?

**Example Answers**:
1. main.func, main.return_func
2. main.func
3.
