[//]: # (MAIN: si.Main)
The instantiation of a class should trigger its static initializer. The class ```si.Demo``` has an
explictly defined static initializer. When a new instance of the ```si.Demo``` class is created in
```si.Main```'s main method, the static initializer of ```si.Demo``` must be executed.
